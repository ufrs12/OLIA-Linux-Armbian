Images based on Armbian Linux for [OLIA](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLIA) and [OLxA](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLxA).  

Building images is carried out in [OLIA-Linux-Armbian-builder](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLIA-Linux-Armbian-builder).

stack.md  - A stack of software that can be included in the image.  
boards.md - List of boards for which development is underway.

## Getting started

### 1. Getting the image

There are two ways to get the image:
* Build with [OLIA Linux Armbian builder](https://github.com/ufrs12/OLIA-Linux-Armbian-builder)
* Download from my [site](https://osjob.ru/)

### 2. Ð¡reate a bootable sd-card

#### From Windows

* I usually use the [Rufus](https://rufus.ie)
* But I can also recommend the [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)

#### From Linux with GUI

I use the [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)

#### From Linux without GUI

If you work without a GUI, then I'm sure you know better than me how to do this)))
